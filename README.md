### Welcome to my GitHub page ðŸ‘‹

I like to build stuff with JavaScript. You can find some of my projects here. Currently I am learning Vue.js.

My biggest project so far is [Actors Info](https://actorsinfo.herokuapp.com/), definitely check that out and leave me some feedback.

In case you know German, you can find JavaScript tutorials on my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRYxf9qolDaBGkZ9k_j4Ovg).

You can reach me via scriptraccoon [at] gmail [dot] com.
